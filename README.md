Here's an example of a `README.md` file that you can include in your "Image Recognition for Wildlife Conservation" project to provide an overview, instructions, and details about the project.

# Image Recognition for Wildlife Conservation

This project showcases an image recognition system using deep learning for wildlife conservation purposes. It utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model for transfer learning to classify images as "Wildlife" or "Not Wildlife." The project includes a FastAPI web API for real-time predictions on uploaded images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow
- FastAPI
- Pillow

Install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Train and save the model weights using the provided `train_model.ipynb` notebook.

2. Run the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

3. Access the API at `http://localhost:8000/predict/` to upload an image for wildlife classification.

### Project Structure

- `main.py`: FastAPI application code for serving predictions.
- `model_weights.h5`: Pre-trained model weights.
- `train_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for model training.
